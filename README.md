# AI Study Buddy

Hi! This is my small project made during my AI & Cloud internship.  
It helps students study better using AI.

## What it can do

- Explain topics in simple words  
- Summarize long notes  
- Make quiz questions and answers  
- Create flashcards for quick revision  

---

## Why I made this

Sometimes it's hard to understand topics or revise fast.  
So I made this tool that uses AI to make studying easier.  
It is built with **Python** and **Streamlit**, and uses **Google Gemini API**.

---

## How to run (if you want to test locally)

1. Clone this repo  
2. Install the packages  
3. Add your Gemini API key in `.streamlit/secrets.toml` like this: GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
4. Run using this command: streamlit run app.py

## Notes

- This is a simple student project  
- I tried to keep it easy and not too fancy  
- Don’t share your API key anywhere
